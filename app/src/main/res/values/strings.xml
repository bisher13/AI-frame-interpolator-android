    <string name="info_text">This app uses frame interpolation to create smooth slow-motion videos. Select a video, choose your desired frame rate multiplier (2x-10x), and process. The app will extract frames, generate intermediate frames using AI, and encode them into a new high-framerate video.\n\nNote: Processing may take several minutes depending on video length and device performance.</string>
